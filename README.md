# mongoDB
setting up MongoDB with mongoose.  Start the frontend server in one command line tab, then perform your CRUD operations in another tab.  Make sure you have the correct connectionString/mongoURI and make sure you have your environmental variables in a .env file or declare them in the same terminal window/command line that you start your server in.
